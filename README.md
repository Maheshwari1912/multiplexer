# multiplexer

Introduction

A Multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output. It operates like a digital switch.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features

Select Lines: Control which input is sent to the output.

Data Inputs: The signals from which the MUX selects.

Single Output: The result of the selected input.

ðŸ“˜ Types of Multiplexers

2:1 MUX (2 inputs, 1 output, 1 select line)

4:1 MUX (4 inputs, 1 output, 2 select lines)

8:1 MUX (8 inputs, 1 output, 3 select lines)
